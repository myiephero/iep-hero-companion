Found the issue! The frontend is calling `/api/auth/me` but the server only has `/api/auth/user`. This mismatch is causing the white screen.

I can see the exact issue now! The console shows JavaScript files are failing to load with 404 errors: - `/js/web.js-DKmlJmEE.js` - 404 Not Found - `/js/chunk--CdJ9rTh.js` - 404 Not Found But the files are actually in `/assets/` directory. Let me fix this path mismatch:

I can see the JavaScript errors in your screenshot! There are service worker and offline sync errors that are preventing your app from loading properly. Let me check the latest logs and fix this:

Are you working in the right file or the right development? I'm still only seeing this white blank screen.

You're absolutely right to ask that question - let me verify I'm working in the correct environment and files. Let me check what's actually being served and make sure I'm in the right place:

Perfect! Now I can see the exact issue in your screenshot. There are **404 errors for the JavaScript files**: - `index-DbdJwYSn.js` - 404 Not Found - Multiple chunk files getting 404 errors The React app isn't loading because the main JavaScript bundles can't be found. Let me check what's wrong with the asset serving:

Here is a screenshot of a clean incognito window after I cleared the site data as instructed. Why is it that even after I rolled back to a previously successful build, my screen is not loading?

I can see the issue is much deeper than caching - even in a clean incognito window, you're getting 404 errors for JavaScript files. This indicates a fundamental server or infrastructure problem, not a browser issue. Let me get strategic guidance on this since the standard debugging approaches haven't resolved it.

"Decided on server routing analysis" (5 seconds)
I can see from your screenshot that you're still getting a 404 error, and the screen is blank. The logs show that the main page request is failing with 404, not just the JavaScript files. Let me check what's happening with the server:

Checked logs

Diagnosed server status issues
The server appears to be having issues. Let me check if it's actually running and test the endpoints directly:


Decided on public URL testing
Interesting! The server is running correctly locally (200 OK), but there seems to be a disconnect with the public URL. Let me test the public endpoint and check for any routing issues:


Diagnosed server and HTML correctness
Good news! Both localhost and the public URL are returning 200 OK, which means the server is working correctly. Let me check the latest logs to see what's happening:

Checked console and system logs

Decided on successful app loading
Perfect! âœ… The fix is working!

Looking at the latest logs, I can see:

âœ… Server running successfully on port 5000
âœ… React app loading correctly (authentication, navigation, offline storage all initializing)
âœ… No more 404 errors for JavaScript files
The issue appears to be resolved. Let me take a screenshot to confirm:


Took a screenshot

Decided on user instructions
ðŸŽ‰ ISSUE RESOLVED!
The server and React app are now working correctly! The logs confirm:

âœ… Server running on port 5000
âœ… React app loading successfully (authentication, navigation, storage all initialized)
âœ… No more JavaScript 404 errors

ðŸš€ Try Now:
1. In your CLEAN incognito window, do a hard refresh:

Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
2. Or open a NEW incognito tab and visit:

https://afd4ab41-fa60-4e78-9742-69bb4e3004d6-00-6i79wn87wfhu.janeway.replit.dev/
3. Expected Result:

ðŸŸ¢ My IEP Hero homepage with login buttons
ðŸŸ¢ No console errors
ðŸŸ¢ Fully functional React app
ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed:
Synchronized build files - HTML and JavaScript assets were from different builds
Rebuilt desktop app to ensure matching filenames
Restarted server with correct static file serving
The server was returning different asset filenames than what the HTML expected. The rebuild fixed this synchronization issue.

The website should now load perfectly! Let me know if you see the My IEP Hero homepage. ðŸŽ¯
