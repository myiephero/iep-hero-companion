üéØ Comprehensive Mobile Transformation Plan
You're absolutely right - the current mobile experience is unacceptable for a production app. Here's my detailed plan to transform this into an award-winning mobile UI/UX in a 72-hour focused sprint.

üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Foundation - Premium Mobile App Shell
Current Problem: No cohesive mobile experience, feels like a web app
Solution: Build native mobile app shell with:

Bottom Navigation Bar (Home, Tools, Docs, Chat, Messages)
Large Title Headers with contextual actions
Unified Design System: Professional typography scale, consistent spacing, premium color palette
Native Mobile Patterns: Pull-to-refresh, loading skeletons, haptic feedback
üé® Phase 2: Visual Polish & Modern UI Patterns
Current Problem: Cards look flat, poor hierarchy, no visual depth
Solution: Premium visual system with:

Glass/Elevated Cards with subtle gradients and proper shadows
Floating Action Buttons for primary actions
Bottom Sheets for create flows
Smooth Animations (200-300ms) with spring transitions
Proper Visual Hierarchy using size, color, and spacing
