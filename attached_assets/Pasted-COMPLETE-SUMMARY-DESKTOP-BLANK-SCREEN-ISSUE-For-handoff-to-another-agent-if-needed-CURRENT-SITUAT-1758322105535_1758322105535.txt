COMPLETE SUMMARY - DESKTOP BLANK SCREEN ISSUE
For handoff to another agent if needed

CURRENT SITUATION
Platform: Desktop web application only (NOT mobile/Capacitor)
Issue: Persistent blank screen despite multiple fix attempts
Environment: Development mode using Vite build system
Server: Running on port 5000, serving static builds
Status: ❌ STILL BROKEN - blank screen persists after all attempts
DIAGNOSTIC EVIDENCE
React Services Loading: ✅ Auth, Offline Storage, Universal Links all initialize
Service Worker: ✅ Registers successfully
Server: ✅ Running and serving files
Console: ❌ No browser console output in latest logs (concerning)
Build: ✅ Compiles without errors
ROOT CAUSE THEORY
Expert architect diagnosed this as Service Worker caching issue where stale cached content persists across deployments and rollbacks, causing blank screens even when React initializes properly.

ALL ATTEMPTED FIXES (CHRONOLOGICAL)
1. CAPACITOR iOS FIXES ❌ Failed - Not relevant to desktop
Removed custom SceneDelegate/AppDelegate code
Fixed allowNavigation configuration
Relaxed App Transport Security settings
Result: No impact on desktop issue
2. SERVICE WORKER FIXES ❌ Failed
Files Modified:

apps/desktop/public/sw.js - Updated cache names to v2
apps/desktop/src/main.tsx - Added proper Service Worker scoping
Changes:

Cache names: iep-hero-cache-v1 → iep-hero-desktop-cache-v2
Added scope: '/' to registration
Added skipWaiting() and clients.claim() for immediate activation
Result: Builds successful, but blank screen persists

3. REACT APP IMPORT FIXES ❌ Failed
File Modified: apps/desktop/src/App.tsx

Changes:

Added missing import: import { queryClient } from "@/lib/queryClient"
Removed duplicate import on line 162
Fixed QueryClientProvider configuration
Result: TypeScript errors resolved, builds clean, but blank screen persists

4. CACHE CLEARING INSTRUCTIONS ❌ User reports still failing
Instructed manual browser cache clearing
Service Worker unregistration
Hard refresh attempts
Result: User reports blank screen still present

TECHNICAL DETAILS FOR NEXT AGENT
Architecture
Build System: Vite with React + TypeScript
Framework: React Router, TanStack Query, Shadcn/UI
Auth: Custom token-based system with Supabase
Project Structure: Monorepo with separate desktop/mobile apps
Key Files
Main App: apps/desktop/src/App.tsx - React Router configuration
Entry Point: apps/desktop/src/main.tsx - Root mounting and Service Worker
Index Page: apps/desktop/src/pages/Index.tsx - Homepage component
Build Output: apps/desktop/dist/ - Static files served by Express
Server Configuration
Port: 5000
Server File: server/index.ts
Routing: Root URL serves desktop, /m serves mobile
Current Status: Server running, serving files correctly
SUSPICIOUS SYMPTOMS
React initializes but UI doesn't render (suggests rendering/CSS issue)
No browser console logs in latest refresh (suggests page not loading)
Service Worker fixes didn't help (suggests deeper issue)
Rollbacks don't work (confirms environmental/caching problem)
UNEXPLORED POSSIBILITIES
CSS/Tailwind compilation issues - Styles may not be loading
Vite configuration problems - Asset resolution failures
Route configuration errors - Router may not be matching paths
Browser-specific issues - Need to test different browsers
Network/asset loading failures - Check Network tab in DevTools
RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS
Browser DevTools Analysis: Check Network tab, Console errors, Elements DOM
CSS Inspection: Verify Tailwind styles are loading and applying
Alternative Testing: Try different browsers, incognito mode
Route Debugging: Add console.log to Index component to verify rendering
Nuclear Option: Fresh git clone/checkout if caching is truly persistent
CONCLUSION
Despite confident diagnosis and multiple targeted fixes, the desktop blank screen persists. The issue appears to be more fundamental than Service Worker caching or import errors. A fresh perspective with deeper debugging would be valuable.

Recommendation: Proceed with rollback to known working state, then approach with systematic debugging from ground up.
