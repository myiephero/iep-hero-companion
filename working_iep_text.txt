SUMMARY OF PRESENT LEVELS OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT AND FUNCTIONAL PERFORMANCE
Mom is in agreement with the teams decisions. The counselor explained summer school, dates, and that there will not be related
services available (i.e. counseling services or BSP support during summer school. She shared some of Izabella's behaviors from
her perspective such as preferring to be in the company of adults, playing one person against another. She does not wish to
include Izabella in IEP meetings. Mom provided a copy of Izabella's treatment plan from San Marcos Treatment, San Marcos, TX
that lists Problem/Diagnoses': Bipolar1, Autism Spectrum Disorder, and ADHD. Mom agreed to provide the evaluation information
for the ASD for the file.
Performance in General Education
Parent Input for Enhancing Child's Education
Strengths of Student (Academic, Behavioral, Learning Characteristics)
Academic Achievement
Izabella is able to generate questions before, during and after reading on assigned and self-selected text. Izabella can
determine author's purpose on self-selected text. Izabella works well independently and advocates for herself when in
need, She is able to evaluate numerical expressions, use critical thinking skills, use models and graphs when engaged.
Izabella is able to understand and follow classroom guidelines and procedures, she works well independently and in
small groups. She is polite helpful and treats others with respect.
Needs as They Impact Learning
Academic Achievement
Izabella is currently  below grade level in the areas of reading comprehension and grade level vocabulary. She struggles
with planning and brainstorming first drafts of essays, with writing and solving a two step linear equations. Izabella
struggles to communicate openly and appropriately at times and sometimes uses the wrong tone or word choice if
challenged. She is easily distracted and has difficulty completing tasks in non-preferred or challenging classes. Izabella
demonstrates work avoidance. When she has negative interactions with her peers, Isabella is easily triggered and
struggles to respond in appropriate ways.
Effect of disability on Progress in the General Curriculum and Needs of Student to Access the General Curriculum
Izabella's disability impacts her ability to access grade level curriculum because of difficulties with motivation and
focus as well as difficulties advocating for herself both academically and emotionally. She continues to be easily
distracted by her peers. Counseling services and Autism consult will remain. (per San Marcos Treatment Center
treatment plan). See attached.

Additional Information:
Input from current teachers:
Art:
Strengths - Izabella is very creative and initiates great project ideas
Weaknesses - Izabella is very caught up in the social aspects of school so she is easily distracted by conversations, and often prefers to sit
and listen over working on a project. I have not had the opportunity to assess her basic art knowledge, though typically to be in Art 3 she
should have all the basics well in hand.
Math:
Strengths - Izabella is a hard worker and is always trying her best. She has been good about asking questions and asking for help if she does
not understand something.
Weaknesses - Izabella sometimes is very social and needs reminders to stay focused and to continue to work. She also is struggling with the
material in Math 8 because we are currently reviewing for the SOL and we have already learned all the material. She said that the material that
we are reviewing she did not learn at her other school.
Recommendations - The accommodations she currently has on her IEP are appropriate and I think she needs to keep them.
Science:
Strengths-she will do work (it takes a long time to get her started-work avoidance)
Weaknesses-always wants to eat (even asks for snacks or others lunches), always touches, grabs or hits others (seems like horseplay but
becomes serious quickly)
Recommendations-she needs a contract to not touch, eat 0r ask for food during class time and to do assignment on hand for the most part
before leaving for bathroom (goes every 4th block longer than allowed-pass is 5 minutes and she takes 10 minutes) Work ethic seems average
for what I have seen in science.
English:
Izabella responds well to positive reinforcement and is friendly when dealt with positively, but she does have a rude streak that comes out
when asked to do things she doesn't want to do.  She is a very social kid, which can be a strength, but this can also be a distraction depending
on what we're doing in class.  She is very work resistant and requires pretty direct supervision for most tasks.  I'm developing a good rapport
with her, but it does feel like walking a tightrope sometimes as her moods can change quickly.
History:
I believe Isabella wants to do well and is a willing worker when focused.  She really likes working with others and can be really productive when
working in a positive environment.  The opposite is true when she has negative interactions with her peers. In those situations Isabella is easily
triggered and struggles to respond in appropriate ways. She also finds it challenging to get back on task in a timely manner.  I highly
recommend that class makeup is taken into consideration when scheduling her classes. A Kind, positive and reasonable classroom
environment will help Isabella immensely.
Izabella has been registered less than 30 days.

SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS
Assistive Technology
Behavioral Needs
Student with Limited English Proficiency
Blind/Visually Impaired
Deaf/Hearing Impaired
The team considered the student's need for Assistive Technology and determined that it is not necessary.
The team considered the student's need for positive behavioral interventions, supports and strategies to address
behaviors that impede learning of self or others and determined that these are not necessary.
In the case of a student with limited English proficiency, consider the language needs of the student as those needs
relate to the student's IEP. It has been determined that this student is not an English Language Learner.
In the case of a student who is blind or is visually impaired, provide for instruction in Braille and the use of Braille unless
the IEP team determines after an evaluation of the student's reading and writing skills, needs, and appropriate reading
and writing media, including an evaluation of the student's future needs for instruction in Braille or the use of Braille, that
instruction in Braille or the use of Braille is not appropriate for the student. When considering that Braille is not
appropriate for the child the IEP team may use the Functional Vision and Learning Media Assessment for Students who
are Pre-Academic or Academic and Visually Impaired in Grades K-12 (FVLMA) or similar instrument. The team
considered if the student has a visual impairment that requires Braille services in order to function at a level consistent
with expected achievement and determined that services are not needed.
In the case of a student who is deaf or hard of hearing, consider the student's language and communication needs,
opportunities for direct communications with peers and professional personnel in the student's language and
communication mode, academic level, and full range of needs, including opportunities for direct instruction in the
student's language and communication mode. The IEP team may use the Virginia Communication Plan when
considering the student's language and communication needs and supports that may be needed. The team considered if
the student has communication needs that require educational communication in an alternate mode preferred by the
student and determined that is not necessary.
The team considered the student's needs for other communication services, supports and goals and determined that
they are not necessary.
Communication
Benchmarks/Short Term Objectives
The team considered the need for benchmarks/short term objectives and determined that the student is not in need of
benchmarks/short term objectives.
Accessible Instructional Materials
No: Izabella does not qualify for AIM
The IEP team has considered the student’s requirement for accessible, alternate format versions of printed textbooks
and printed core instructional materials (Braille, audio text, electronic text, and/or large print) due to a documented
visual, physical or print disability and determined that

EXTENDED SCHOOL YEAR (ESY)
Available data do not demonstrate the need for ESY services
Rationale for decision
The team considered the need for ESY and determined:
The IEP Team should determine if any of the factors below will significantly jeopardize the student's ability to receive some
benefit from the student's educational program during the regular school year, if the student does not receive ESY services. ESY
services are the individualized extension of specific special education and related services that are provided beyond the normal
school year of the public agency, in accordance with the IEP, at no cost to the parents.
When considering ESY, answer YES or NO and document the decision:
1
Significant or substantial regression will occur on IEP goals/related services without extended school year services.
No

LEAST RESTRICTIVE ENVIRONMENT (LRE)
Rationale for LRE selection:
Izabella continues to qualify to receive special education services as a student with Emotional Disability and an Other
Health Impairment (ADHD). Characteristics associated with ADHD and her emotional disability require her to receive
special education services.
LRE options considered
Placement decision:
Progress in the general curriculum is impacted by the disability?
Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)
To the maximum extent appropriate, students with disabilities must be educated with students without disabilities. This is
called the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE). The IEP team determines the placement that is the LRE for the student
based on consideration of all of the following factors: 1) the educational needs of the student, 2) opportunities for
education with age appropriate peers, 3) education in the school that the student would attend if not a student with a
disability, and 4) any potential harmful effect of the placement on the student, the quality of services that the student
needs or on other students.
The student should not be removed from the general education classroom solely because of needed accommodations
or modifications in the general curriculum. Removal from the general education environment occurs only if the nature or
severity of the disability is such that education in general education classes with the use of supplementary aids and
services cannot be achieved satisfactorily.
The services described in this IEP are designated for implementation in a school and/or remote location. The IEP
services designated for implementation in a specific location will be available to the Student on the days the Student is
administratively assigned by the school division to that location during the regular school year. The assignment of the
Student to a location for IEP implementation may vary during the course of the school year based on the ability of the
school division to offer services in the particular location. If, during the school year, the School Board, as a result of a
health emergency or other concerns, changes the number of days per week that the Student is assigned to attend
instruction at school, then the IEP services designated for delivery in a school location will be adjusted to align with the
number of days that the Student is assigned to attend instruction at school.
Despite any other statement in the IEP to the contrary, the IEP services will not be implemented, and the school division
has no obligation to make-up any missed services, on days when the school division does not offer instruction, whether
virtually or in-person, for reasons such as inclement weather, closures due to teacher unavailability, pandemics, health
emergencies, the Student illness, the Student's inability to participate for safety or health reasons, holidays, partial days,
partial weeks, and teacher planning days. The IEP services will also not be provided during the summer months unless
services are specified for the Student in the Extended School Year section of the IEP.
By signing and granting consent to this IEP, the parent(s)/guardian(s) grant consent for the adjustment of IEP services
between the school and remote locations based on the School Board's: assignment of the Student to a location for IEP
implementation; the School Board's decision to open and close school buildings or classrooms; and/or the availability of
specific services at a particular location. The parent(s)/guardian(s) are further granting consent to adjusting the means of
delivery of instruction (in-person vs. telephonically or virtually), without holding an IEP meeting before implementing such
a change in methodology.  Nothing prevents the parent(s)/guardian(s) or school staff from requesting an IEP meeting to
discuss amendments/revisions to IEP. Check box of educational options selected for primary placement and write a
rationale for selected option. The following options were selected:
Public Day School
Public Separate School
Home Based Placement
Private Separate School
